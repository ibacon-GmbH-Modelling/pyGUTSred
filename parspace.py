'''
Class for a paramter space explorer in python.

This implementation is heavily based on the BYOM and openGUTS parameter space 
explorer code written by Dr. Tjalling Jager. The original code is written in 
Matlab and can be found here: https://www.debtox.info/byom.html

The original MATLAB files are located in the engine folder of openGUTS 
or in the engine and engine_par folder of the BYOM release.

The rewriting of this software made use of the GitHub Copilot, which is based
on AI technology.
